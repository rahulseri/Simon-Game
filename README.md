# Simon-Game
ğŸ”µğŸŸ¢ğŸ”´ğŸŸ¡ The Simon game is a classic memory game! It has colorful buttons that light up and play tones. The game lights up a sequence of buttons, and the player has to repeat that sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. If you get it right, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.
